<h1>About:</h1>
<br>
<h3> <strong>The Site:</strong> </h3>
<br>
<p class="h5">
This website is created using Python's Django Framework. <br><br>
It allows any user to add products to a MYSQL database. <br><br>
The products can be updated, deleted and read. <br><br>
The front end is responsive, meaning it will adapt to mobile devices and smaller screen sizes. <br><br>
When the screen is shrunk down, the navbar will turn into a dropdown menu. <br><br>
THis site has an Admin section as all Django sites do, but it is only accessable to administrators. <br><br>
This is mostly styled using BootStrap and little bit of CSS. <br><br>
This will be hosted on Amazon Web Services.
