This website is created using Python's Django Framework.
It allows any user to add products to a MYSQL database. 
The products can be updated, deleted and read. 
The front end is responsive, meaning it will adapt to mobile devices and smaller screen sizes.
When the screen is shrunk down, the navbar will turn into a dropdown menu.
THis site has an Admin section as all Django sites do, but it is only accessable to administrators. 
This is mostly styled using BootStrap and little bit of CSS.
This will be hosted on Amazon Web Services.

The site and database are live on AWS, I have given the site a domain name and a secure HTTPS encryption:

!Update I have taken this site off of AWS it is no longer hosted!
